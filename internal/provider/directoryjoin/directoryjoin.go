// Package directoryjoin is the directory capability's acting half (design
// 0009 §6): joining a machine to the domain the host record asks for.
//
// It only ever JOINS. It never unjoins, and it never re-joins a machine that
// is already in the target domain. Leaving a domain stays a deliberate,
// separately-expressed act, because the cost is real and asymmetric: a
// rejoin resets the computer account's password and, where the object is
// recreated, gives the machine a new SID -- losing its group memberships,
// its escrowed BitLocker keys, its LAPS password and any certificate issued
// to it. None of that may ever be a side effect of an admin editing a field.
//
// The other half, moving an already-joined machine's computer object between
// OUs, is NOT here: that is a property of an object in a directory, so the
// server does it with one LDAP Modify DN and the machine is not involved
// (design 0009 §5, FOG\Agent\DirectoryPlacement). The OU on this side is
// only the container the object is CREATED in, which saves a move that would
// otherwise have to follow every first join.
